# Handwriting Digit Detection - Binary Classifier

This project implements a simple handwriting digit detection model, focusing on binary classification of digits. The aim is to detect and classify handwritten digits into two classes: digit vs. non-digit (or another specified binary division).

## Project Overview
This project uses a machine learning model to detect handwritten digits, focusing specifically on binary classification. The binary classification can be adjusted based on the desired classes, for example:
- Digit `0` vs. Digit `1`
- Digits `0-4` vs. Digits `5-9`

The model is trained on images of handwritten digits and can be extended to more complex scenarios or modified for multi-class classification in the future.

## Dataset
The project uses the MNIST dataset, a widely used dataset for digit recognition tasks. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits, each of size 28x28 pixels.

### Data Preprocessing
- **Normalization**: Pixel values are normalized to a range of 0-1.
- **Binarization**: The dataset is filtered or adjusted to convert it into a binary classification problem.

## Model Architecture
The model is built using a simple neural network architecture. Here's a brief description:
- **Input Layer**: Takes a 28x28 pixel image, flattened into a 784-dimensional vector.
- **Hidden Layers**: One or more fully connected layers with ReLU activation.
- **Output Layer**: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation for binary classification.

Alternatively, convolutional neural network (CNN) layers can be added to improve accuracy on complex data.
